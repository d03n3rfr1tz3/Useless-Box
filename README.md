# Useless Box
Arduino Sketch for a Useless Box I build for our little one. Maybe it helps someone with their own Useless Box, especially with the part
of moving the Servos while simultanously changing other PWM controlled components.

## Description
Our variant of the Useless Box has some additional features. Here is the full list of features and components that define this variant:

* **MG996R Servo**, which is strong enough to lift the Cover
* **9g 180° Clutch Servo** from DFRobot, which moves the Hand
* **RCWL-0516 Microwave Radar** which uses the doppler effect to detect movement even through the wooden box
* **Piezo Buzzer** for a simple birdlike sound
* **TP4056 LiPo Charger** including some LiPo batteries
